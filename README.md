# Credit Card Fraud Detection ‚Äì Predictive Modeling Project


## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a **predictive machine learning model** to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using anonymized transaction data. The challenge is especially interesting due to the **extremely imbalanced dataset**, where fraudulent transactions are a very small fraction of the total transactions.

This project walks through the complete ML lifecycle ‚Äî from data cleaning, EDA, and preprocessing to model building, evaluation, and final prediction using different supervised learning techniques.

## üìÇ Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from **Kaggle‚Äôs Credit Card Fraud Detection** challenge. It contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.

- Total observations: **284,807**
- Fraudulent transactions: **492**
- Features: 30 (Anonymized PCA features + `Time`, `Amount`, and `Class`)

   - Confusion Matrix visualization
   - Cross-validation for robustness
6. **Final Results**
   - Model comparison
   - Best-performing algorithm identified
   - Discussion on trade-offs between recall and precision

## üöÄ Key Findings

- The dataset is **highly imbalanced** (~0.17% fraud cases), requiring custom sampling techniques.
- **Precision and Recall** were prioritized over accuracy due to the cost of false negatives.
- Among various models, **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** gave the most balanced and robust performance.
- SMOTE-based oversampling improved minority class detection but needed tuning to avoid overfitting.
